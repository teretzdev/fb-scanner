### Step 4: Review the Code
- **Purpose Fulfilled**: The `package.json` file defines the React frontend's metadata, scripts, dependencies, and Node.js version, aligning with the project's requirements.
- **Conventions Followed**: The file adheres to the conventions used in the existing `package.json` files in the codebase.
- **Completeness**: All required fields are implemented, and the file is ready to be used for managing the frontend's dependencies and scripts.
- **Error Handling**: The file includes all necessary dependencies and scripts to ensure smooth development and production builds.

### Final Output
The complete `frontend/package.json` file is as follows:
