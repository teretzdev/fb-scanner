### Explanation of the Implementation

1. **Component Structure**:
   - The `Dashboard` component serves as the main interface for the FB Scanner application.
   - It provides navigation links to other parts of the application: Credentials Management, Group URL Manager, and Logs Viewer.

2. **Styling**:
   - The component imports a CSS file (`Dashboard.css`) for styling. This ensures that the styles are scoped to the `Dashboard` component.

3. **Navigation**:
   - The `Link` component from `react-router-dom` is used for navigation, ensuring seamless transitions between routes.

4. **Content**:
   - Each feature (Credentials, Group URLs, Logs) is represented as a card with a title, description, and a link to the respective route.

5. **Footer**:
   - A footer is included to provide branding and copyright information.

### Review Checklist
- **Purpose Fulfilled**: The component provides an overview of the application's features and navigation to other components, as required.
- **Conventions Followed**: The code uses React functional components, `react-router-dom` for navigation, and scoped CSS for styling, consistent with the codebase.
- **Completeness**: The file is fully functional, with no placeholders or incomplete code.
- **Error Handling**: Not applicable for this component, as it is a static interface.
- **Styling**: The component is styled using a dedicated CSS file (`Dashboard.css`), ensuring maintainability and consistency.

### Final Output
